# Vacancies Portal Frontend

A vacancies portal developed with Next js (React metaframework) and Typescript, it consumes data from this [django backend](https://github.com/Sebas3270/vacancies-portal-backend), also developed by me.

You can filter the vacancies, apply to them, create you account, upload your cv, etc.
